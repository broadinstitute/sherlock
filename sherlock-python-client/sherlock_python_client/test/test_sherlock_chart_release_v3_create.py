    Sherlock

    The Data Science Platform's source-of-truth service. Note: this API will try to load and return associations in responses, so clients won't need to make as many requests. This behavior isn't recursive, though, so associations of associations are *not* fully loaded (even if it might seem that way from looking at the data types).
